   * Given a relation and a list of column names, an imputation model
   * is expected to be able to produce replacement values for cells in
   * the specified columns of the specified relation.  
   * 
   * Inputs:
   *    Database        -> The database to train on
   *    String          -> The name prefix for the model
   *    List[String]    -> A list of column names to impute on
   *    Operator        -> The relation to impute on
   * Outputs:
   *    Map[...]        -> A map from column name to a Model/Idx pair,
   *                       along with a sequence of "hint" expressions,
   *                       defining a way to repair the attribute
   *
   * Note that although we request models for a set of columns in a
   * single pass, the constructor is not required to respond with a
   * model for all, or even any of the columns it's given.  
   *   - If the model in question is not applicable to the query, it 
   *     should return an empty map.
   *   - If the model in question is not applicable to one or more 
   *     columns, these columns need not be in the result map.
   * 
   * Imputation models are expected to take a single variable, 
   * identifying the ROWID of the specified row.  In other words, 
   * it should support VGTerms of the form {{ TABLE;x[ROWID] }}.  The
   * domain of the variable should be the same as the type of the 
   * specified column.
   * 
   * Note that the constructor is NOT responsible for registering the
   * model with the manager.
   *
   * The original row may be constructed from the provided relation
   * operator: Select[ROWID = rowid](oper)
